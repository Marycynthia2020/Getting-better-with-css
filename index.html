            <p>Within my stay in Stutern, I have understood how CSS box model works. The box model wraps the HTML elemet. It consists of padding, margin, borders and the actual content. Below I will give a brief description of margin, padding and borders </p>
            <h4>Padding</h4>
            Padding is the distance between the content and the border. It is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
            <h4>Margins</h4>
            <p>Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. Just like paddings, you can set margin for each side of an element </p>
            <h4>Border</h4>
            <p>The border wraps both the content and the margin and separates them from the margin. CSS border properties allows you to add color, width, and style of your element.</p>
